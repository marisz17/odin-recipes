        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Skopo, otherwise known as “Smiley” is a classic South African delicacy. The meal consisting of a sheep head gained notoriety amongst Zulu taxi drivers and is now found at every taxi rank or township corner throughout South Africa.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sheep head</li>
            <li>2 onions</li>
            <li>2 chilli beef cubes</li>

            <li>Barbecue spice</li>
            <li>Steak & Chops spice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If you want to go the traditional route, we suggest you use 2 chilli beef stock cubes so that the Skopo has a flavour-filled base to marinate in.</li>
            <li>Chop the onions into smaller pieces</li>
            <li>Place stove on medium heat</li>
            <li>Add boiling water to large pot</li>
            <li>Add the Skopo to the large pot of boiling water</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion pieces</li>
            <li>Boil for 30 minutes before adding the chilli beef stock</li>
            <li>Boil for another hour or so and add brown onion soup to create a sauce for your skopo</li>
            <li>(Always have a kettle of boiling water ready incase your pot gets dry)</li>
            <li>Continue cooking the meal while stirring for an hour and a half or 2 hours (Depends on how soft your want the meat to be)</li>
            <li>Once satisfied with the texture of your meat you can switch off the stove and let it simmer</li>
            <li>One can then either decide to eat as is with pap but because it’s festive and every meal is a statement, we going gourmet and making further changes.</li>
            <li>Remove your Skopo from the chilli beef broth and place in an oven pan.</li>
            <li>Add your favourite spices but we suggest barbecue spice and steak and chops.</li>
            <li>Add a little olive oil and place in the oven for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the Skopo is golden brown and the smell can’t be ignored, then you know it’s ready.</li>
